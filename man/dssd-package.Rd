\title{Distance Sampling Survey Design (dssd)}
\description{
Creates survey designs for distance sampling surveys. These
 designs can be assessed for various effort and coverage statistics.
 Once the user is satisfied with the design characteristics they can
 generate a set of transects to use in their distance sampling survey.
 Many of the designs implemented in this R package were first made
 available in our 'Distance' for Windows software and are detailed in
 Chapter 7 of Advanced Distance Sampling, Buckland et. al. (2008,
 ISBN-13: 978-0199225873).
}
\details{
The main functions in this package are: \link{make.region}, \link{make.design}, \link{generate.transects} and \link{run.coverage}. See also \link{write.transects} for examples of how to export surveys generated by dssd.

Further information on distance sampling methods and example code is available at \url{http://distancesampling.org/R/}.

Also see our website for vignettes / example code at \url{http://examples.distancesampling.org}.
