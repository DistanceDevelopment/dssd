DSsim 0.1.0
-----------

Introducing the new Distance Sampling Survey Design package!

dssd implements the following designs:
 * Point transects: Simple random sampling
 * Point trasnects: Systematic grid with random start point
 * Line transects: Parallel random lines
 * Line transects: Systematic parallel lines with a random start
 * Line transects: Equal spaced zigzags with a random start
 * Line transects: Equal spaced zigzags with complementary set of zigzags
 
dssd also implements the following feature options:
 * Ability to vary design angle
 * Survey generation by number of samplers, spacing or line length (can generate by different criteria in each strata)
 * Ability to use different designs in each strata (as long as they are of the same type, i.e. all point or all line transects)
 * Generate plus or minus sampling surveys
 * Generate zigzag design inside minimum bounding rectangles (angled along the design axis) or convex hulls
 * Calculates the coverage of different design by simulation
 * Produces summary statistics from the coverage design showing the variability in number of samplers, line length, % coverage across surveys from a given design
