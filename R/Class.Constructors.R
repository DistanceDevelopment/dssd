#' @title  Creates a Survey.Design object
#' @description Creates a description of a survey design. Designs may use different
#' types of either point or line transect designs across strata but cannot mix
#' point and line transect design types within a single design object.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' \strong{Plus versus Minus Sampling}
#' If you choose for your design to use a minus sampling strategy then transects will
#' only be generated within the survey region and will give lower coverage around the
#' edge of the survey region. Plus sampling generates transects within an area
#' greater than the study region. To do this \pkg{dssd} first puts a buffer around the
#' study region before generating the transects within the buffered region. The width
#' of the buffer is the truncation distance supplies by the user. Plus sampling
#' helps to ensure more even coverage around the edge of the study area. See
#' \emph{Buckland et. al, 2001} "Introduction to Distance Sampling" for information
#' on when to use plus versus minus sampling.
#'
#' \strong{Point Transect Designs}
#' For point transect designs the user may either specify "random" or
#' "systematic" for the design argument. If the user specifies "random", they
#' should also provide a value for effort detailing the number of point transects
#' they wish their survey to have. For stratified designs they may specify a vector
#' of numbers detailing the number of transects per strata or alternatively use the
#' effort.allocation argument to allocate a total effort amount proportionally. If
#' effort.allocation is left blank then effort will be allocated according to strata
#' area. If the user specified"systematic" they may either provide their desired number
#' of samplers or a value for spacing which defines the gap between each of the
#' points (again a vector of spacing values can be provided for each strata).
#' Optionally the user may select a design.angle. For both random and systematic
#' point transect designs the user may select either a minus or plus sampling edge
#' protocol.
#'
#' \strong{Line Transect Designs:}
#' For line transect designs the user may either specify "random" (randomly
#' placed full width lines), "systematic" (systematically placed full width lines),
#' "eszigzag" (equally spaced zigzag lines), "eszigzagcom" (two sets of complementary
#' equally spaced zigzag lines) or "segmentedgrid" (a grid of short line transect
#' segments). If the user specifies "random", they should provide the either the
#' number of samplers they wish the design to generate or the line length they wish
#' to achieve, either by strata or as a total. If the user specifies "systematic"
#' they should specify either the number of samplers, the desired line length or
#' the spacing between lines. The design angle for these parallel line designs
#' refers to the angle of the lines where 0 is a vertical line and moving round
#' in a clockwise direction. If the user specifies a zigzag design they should
#' specify the systematic spacing value, number of samplers or line length to be
#' used and should choose between generating the design in a minimum bounding
#' rectangle or a convex hull. The default is minimum bounding rectangle which gives
#' more even coverage but the convex hull is generally more efficient. A segmented
#' grid design may be generated using the either the number of samplers or total
#' line length, combined with a value for segment length. Alternatively the user
#' may specify a values for spacing and segment length. The segmented grid design
#' also uses the segment threshold argument. All the designs may be generated
#' using plus or minus sampling protocols. Similar to the point transect designs
#' different values may be specified for each strata for all of the above options.
#' The design angle for the zigzag designs refers to the angle of a line which
#' would run through the middle of each zigzag transect if the zigzags were to
#' be generated within a rectangle. The design angle for zigzags should usually
#' run along the longest dimension of the study region.
#'
#' NOTE: If multiple global design effort arguments are supplied (i.e. spacing,
#' samplers, line.length) then only the first of spacing then line.length then
#' number of samplers will be used. The other values provided will be discarded.
#' Different design effort arguments may supplied for different strata. This is
#' achieved by supplying vectors of numeric values for each of the desired
#' effort measures, there should be 1 value for each stratum. A value indicates
#' the effort for that stratum and NA's should be used to ensure that only one
#' measure of effort is defined for each stratum.
#'
#' \strong{Effort Allocation:}
#' For multi-strata designs users are able to define a single global effort value,
#' for example number of samplers or line length, and allocate proportions of it
#' to each stratum using the effort.allocation argument. If a global effort value
#' is supplied and effort.allocation is not defined then effort is assigned
#' based on stratum area. This should lead to a design which is at least
#' approximately equal effort across strata. In the case where all strata use the
#' same systematic design then in the absence of effort.allocation the spacing will
#' be calculated globally and exactly equal effort will be achieved. In the case
#' where different designs are chosen for different strata or a non-systematic
#' design is selected then effort and spacing values will be calculated at the
#' stratum level and this can lead to some variations in coverage between strata.
#'
#' See the Getting Started Vignette and the Multiple Strata in dssd Vignette for
#' example designs.
#'
#' @param region an object of class Region defining the survey region.
#' @param transect.type character variable specifying either "line" or "point"
#' @param design a character variable describing the type of design. Either "random",
#' "systematic", "eszigzag" (equal-spaced zigzag), "eszigzagcom" (equal spaced zigzag
#' with complementary lines) or "segmentedgrid". See details for more information.
#' @param samplers the number of samplers you wish the design to generate
#' (note that the number actually generated may differ slightly due to the
#' shape of the study region for some designs). This may be one value or a value
#' for each stratum.
#' @param line.length the total line length you desire or a vector of line lengths
#' the same length as the number of strata.
#' @param seg.length the length of the line transect segments for a segmented grid
#' design.
#' @param effort.allocation Used for multi-strata regions where only a total effort
#' value is provided. This numeric argument should have one value per stratum indicating
#' the proportion of the total effort to allocate to that stratum. If length is
#' 0 (the default) and only a total line length or total number of samplers is supplied,
#' effort is allocated based on stratum area.
#' @param design.angle numeric value detailing the angle of the design. Can provide
#' multiple values relating to strata. The use of the angle varies with design, it
#' can be either the angle of the grid of points, the angle of lines or the design
#' axis for the zigzag design. See details. In addition, a value of -1 will cause a
#' random design angle to be generated.
#' @param spacing used by systematic designs, numeric value(s) to define spacing
#' between transects. Can be a vector of values with one value per stratum.
#' @param edge.protocol character value indicating whether a "plus" sampling or
#' "minus" sampling protocol is used. See details.
#' @param seg.threshold this is a percentage threshold value applicable to segmented
#' grid designs controlling which partial segments are discarded around the survey
#' region boundary. By default, the value of 50, means that only segments that are
#' more than half inside the survey region will be retained. To retain all segments,
#' no matter how small they are when clipped to the survey region boundary set this
#' value to 0.
#' @param bounding.shape only applicable to zigzag designs. A character value saying
#' whether the zigzag transects should be generated using a minimum bounding
#' "rectangle" or "convex.hull". The default is a minimum bounding rectangle.
#' @param truncation A single numeric value describing the longest distance at which
#' an object may be observed. Truncation distance is constant across strata.
#' @param coverage.grid An object of class Coverage.Grid for use when
#' running the coverage simulation.
#' @return object of a class which inherits from class Survey.Design either
#' Line.Transect.Design or Point.Transect.Design
