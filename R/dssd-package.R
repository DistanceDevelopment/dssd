#' Distance Sampling Survey Design (dssd)
#'
#' Creates survey designs for distance sampling surveys. These
#'  designs can be assessed for various effort and coverage statistics.
#'  Once the user is satisfied with the design characteristics they can
#'  generate a set of transects to use in their distance sampling survey.
#'  Many of the designs implemented in this R package were first made
#'  available in our 'Distance' for Windows software and are detailed in
#'  Chapter 7 of Advanced Distance Sampling, Buckland et. al. (2008,
#'  ISBN-13: 978-0199225873).
#'
#'  The main functions in this package are: \link{make.region}, \link{make.design}, \link{generate.transects} and \link{run.coverage}. See also \link{write.transects} for examples of how to export surveys generated by dssd.
#'
#' Further information on distance sampling methods and example code is available at \url{http://distancesampling.org/R/}.
#'
#' We are also in the process of setting up a new area of the website for vignettes / example code at \url{http://examples.distancesampling.org }. While this is being developed dssd vignettes can still be found within this package.
